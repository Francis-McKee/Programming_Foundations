I am aware of and have read both the Coursera Honor Code and Code of Conduct, and believe that I am not in violation of either by posting my work online. I am not submitting anything for a grade, nor could anyone else submit my work for a grade as these are open assignments that are not for a grade. If anyone from Coursera sees this repository and would like me to remove it or make it private so that only I can view it, please email me at frankmckee1203@gmail.com and I will happily comply.
